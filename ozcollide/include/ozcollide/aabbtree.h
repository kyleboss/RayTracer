 * This is the base class of all implementations of AABB tree that is, the base of OZCollide.
 * Note about the memory's layout.
 * All nodes are placed in one big block. The start of this block is the address of the root's node.
 * All leafs are also placed in one big block.
 * In other words, there are two pointers, one for the nodes array and one for the leafs array.
 * That merely optimizes the memory's layout of the tree.
 * Note we build the tree by only providing memory pointers that could be a little confusing since a given memory pointer is not obviously in the correct memory block.
 * The problem could be minimised by using indices but that would slighty slow further read access.
 * Anyway the AABBs tree construction is not currently in charge of the client and blackboxed.
 * An AABB tree is not directly used, it's implemented via AABBTreeAABB, AABBTreePoly or AABBTreeSphere.
